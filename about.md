My name is Willy Schultz. I am currently working as a software engineer at MongoDB in NYC on their database replication system. Before that I studied at Cornell University and graduated in 2016. My interests recently have been focused on distributed systems and formal methods, specifically the TLA+ specification language.

<!-- I like building, designing, and thinking about technology. My engineering background began with building things out of wood and foam in my dad's machine shop, and from there I moved on to CNC machining, electronics prototyping, and, in the past few years, software engineering and mathematics.

I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at Cornell University, and graduated in 2016. Math has always been a fascination of mine, and I feel that pushing myself to study it at a high level got me to think harder and more carefully about concepts and problems in every discipline. People think of math as numbers and symbols, but really, a lot of math is just about thinking really hard for a long time about one thing. Studying math forced me to think harder, and I value it for that reason.

I'm not a purely theoretical kind of guy. I have always liked seeing how my thoughts and ideas can be applied in the real world. Studying Computer Science and being an engineer lets me apply the precision and clarity of high level abstract thinking to real world stuff. Engineering things well requires a lot of patience, careful thinking, and creativity â€“ not just hacking. I enjoy these intellectual challenges. Additionally, the real world presents wonderful challenges to solve, and sometimes it's those problems that force the development of new theory. There's a quote attributed to Don Knuth on this that I like very much:

"*The best theory is inspired by practice. The best practice is inspired by theory.*"

Recently, I played around with Microsoft's Z3 Theorem Prover, did some hacking on Golang's random number generator, and have been exploring and learning about the TLA+ specification language and its applications to real world systems.

I am currently working as a Software Engineer on the Distributed Systems team at MongoDB in New York City. -->
