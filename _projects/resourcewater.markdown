[resourcewater.org](http://resourcewater.org) is a website I built for the Fairmount Water Works Interpretive Center, an educational resource center in Philadelphia, PA that promotes sustainable use of water and the environment. This website is an online companion to a curriculum guide that they use in conjunction with teachers and educators around the Philadelphia area. The main element of this website is its Content Management System, along with a user login and comment system, which were all built in PHP. It includes a way to for the administrator to update specific content at will, view comments made by the user and respond to them, and to keep track of all the users who have registered for the website. It was one of my very first forays into web development. Uses jQuery, PHP, MySQL database.
