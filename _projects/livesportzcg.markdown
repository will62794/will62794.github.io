This was contractual work I completed for a company named <a href="http://sportzcast.net/">Sportzcast</a> which provides certain types of software solutions for live video streaming of sports events. They have an application called LiveSportzCG that connects to their web servers and decodes data coming from an arena scoreboard so that a user can overlay this real time data onto a web video stream. They had built this application for Windows but they needed a Mac version, which is what I worked on for them. Over the course of about 5 months I ported their Windows application over to the Mac using the Mono Framework.The application integrated some of their C# backend code for server communication, and I rebuilt all the user facing features of the application as a native Mac application. The application also included a C++ plugin for the application Wirecast, from Telestream, Inc., which I wrote to accompany the LiveSportzCG application.
Sportzcast has been in beta testing with the Mac version of the application and is getting ready to release it into production for their users as well as on the Mac App Store.
