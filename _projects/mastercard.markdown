At Cornell University, I participated in the Mastercard Innovation Express, a weekend long hackathon event where several teams of students had to develop concepts for a new Mastercard software product and pitch their ideas to Mastercard executives. Each team required a video to explain and present their product idea, and I produced the video for my team. Our product idea, called "Reward.ing", provides a web portal for customers to use their credit card reward points to crowdfund charity causes. Our team won 1st prize at the competition. A link to the video is below.
