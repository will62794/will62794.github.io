Soundbyte is an iOS app I built that provides a super simple way to send sound clip messages. It kind of takes on the Snapchat idea, but for short sound bytes. The sounds I used are all about 3-12 seconds in length, and you can send them to any other user of the app. I haven't implemented a notion of "friends" yet, as I am still just in the testing phase. Soundbyte uses <a href="https://www.parse.com">Parse</a> for its backend, to store a catalog of sound clips, user ids, and to handle the send and receive message queues for each user. It was mostly just a side project for fun. I might try to release it on the App Store at some point if I can resolve any legal issues regarding sound byte copyrights, etc.
