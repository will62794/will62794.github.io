Sportzcast is a company that provides real time score data feeds. They wanted to create a new product that used an existing video encoder and streaming computer, and integrate their own score data streaming service into it. The customized device would allow users to stream video of their sports game with just a small Linux computer and the live graphics for their game would be generated using the data from Sportzcast's network. I worked on integrating Sportzcast's data service into the boards, developing a way to generate scoreboard graphics in real time, and allow the boards to be remotely controlled and operated via a web interface.
