This was a website I built for Electro Mechanical Systems, a small business in Spring City, PA, that provides design and fabrication services to many types of clients. The website's main feature is a project gallery that presents images and descriptions of projects they have worked on. I built a simple content management system for the user so that they can upload images and create titles and descriptions for each project and annotate and reorder the images for each project. The site is backed by a MySQL database, and uses the PHP Active Record ORM to interface to the database. The front end was built in AngularJS.
