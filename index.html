<h2>William Schultz</h2>

<p>
    I am a PhD student in the formal methods group at Northeastern University where I am advised by <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/stavros-tripakis/">Stavros Tripakis</a>. My research interests are broadly at the intersection of formal verification, synthesis, and distributed systems.

<p>
    Previously I worked as a software engineer at MongoDB on their database replication system. Before that I attended Cornell University, where I studied Math and Computer Science and graduated in 2016.
