title:  "A Tool for Exploring Formal Specifications"
categories: formal-methods specification

Formal specifications are a core part of rigorous distributed systems design and verification, but the existing tools have still been lacking in providing good interfaces for interacting with, exploring, visualizing and sharing these specifications and models in a convenient manner. 

The TLA+ web explorer aims to address this by providing a web-based interface for exploring and visualizing TLA+ formal specifications. 

## Interactive Trace Exploration

Ability to explore traces and and back track, and evaluate trace expressions.

## REPL

As a part of this, we get a nice interface for a REPL, that also can be evaluated in the context of the current loaded specification.

## Visualization

Visualize system states using a simple DSL defined in TLA+.
