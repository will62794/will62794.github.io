If we want to formally prove that a system satisfies some safety property (i.e. invariant), we can do this by finding an *inductive invariant*. An inductive invariant is a particular type of invariant that is at least as strong as the target invariant to be proven, but it is also inductive, meaning that it is closed under all transitions of the system.

For example, for a [formal specification of the two-phase commit protocol](https://github.com/will62794/scimitar/blob/c730a3c0dd410c70ef6ffc79a609d15e9b17fda2/benchmarks/TwoPhase.tla), we may want to establish the core safety property stating that no two resource managers can end up in conflicting commit/abort states:

$$
\small  
\newcommand{\stext}[1]{\small\text{#1}}
\begin{align*}
&TCConsistent \triangleq{} \\
  % A state predicate asserting that two RMs have not arrived at          \\
  % conflicting decisions.                                                \\
  &\hspace{1cm}\forall rm_i, rm_j \in RM : \neg (rmState[rm_i] = \stext{ABORTED} \land rmState[rm_j] = \stext{COMMITTED})
\end{align*}
$$

A possible inductive invariant for establishing this property may look like the following:

$$
\newcommand{\stext}[1]{\text{#1}}
\small
\begin{align*}
Inv73 &\triangleq \forall rm_i \in \text{RM} : \forall rm_j \in \text{RM} : \neg(rmState[rm_i] = \text{"committed"}) \lor \neg(rmState[rm_j] = \text{"working"}) \\
Inv23 &\triangleq \forall rm_i \in \text{RM} :  (rmState[rm_i] = \text{"aborted"}) \Rightarrow  (\langle \stext{Commit} \rangle \notin msgsCommit)\\
Inv11 &\triangleq \forall rm_j \in \text{RM} : \neg(\langle \stext{Abort} \rangle \in msgsAbort) \lor \neg(rmState[rm_j] = \text{"committed"}) \\
Inv2 &\triangleq \forall rm_i \in \text{RM} : \neg(\langle {\stext{Commit}} \rangle \in msgsCommit) \lor \neg(rmState[rm_i] = \text{"working"}) \\
Inv1 &\triangleq \neg(\langle \stext{Abort} \rangle \in msgsAbort) \lor \neg(\langle \stext{Commit} \rangle \in msgsCommit) \\
Inv53 &\triangleq \forall rm_i \in \text{RM} : \neg(rmState[rm_i] = \text{"committed"}) \lor \neg(tmState = \text{"init"}) \\
Inv1140 &\triangleq \forall rm_i \in \text{RM} : (rmState[rm_i] = \text{"prepared"}) \lor (\neg(tmPrepared = \text{RM}) \lor \neg(tmState = \text{"init"})) \\
Inv16 &\triangleq \forall rm_i \in \text{RM} : \neg(rmState[rm_i] = \text{"working"}) \lor \neg(tmPrepared = \text{RM}) \\
Inv1325 &\triangleq \forall rm_j \in \text{RM} : (rmState[rm_j] = \text{"prepared"}) \lor \neg(rm_j \in tmPrepared) \lor \neg(tmState = \text{"init"}) \\
Inv1291 &\triangleq \forall rm_j \in \text{RM} : (rmState[rm_j] = \text{"prepared"}) \lor \neg(\langle \stext{Prepared}, rm \mapsto rm_j \rangle \in msgsPrepared) \lor \neg(tmState = \text{"init"}) \\
Inv29 &\triangleq \forall rm_i \in \text{RM} : \neg(\langle \stext{Prepared}, rm \mapsto rm_i \rangle \in msgsPrepared) \lor \neg(rmState[rm_i] = \text{"working"}) \\
Inv4 &\triangleq \neg(\langle \stext{Commit} \rangle \in msgsCommit) \lor \neg(tmState = \text{"init"}) \\
Inv7 &\triangleq \neg(\langle \stext{Abort} \rangle \in msgsAbort) \lor \neg(tmState = \text{"init"}) \\
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\small
\begin{align*}
Ind \triangleq{}& \\
  &\land Safety \\
  &\land Inv73 \\
  &\land Inv23 \\
  &\land Inv2 \\
  &\land Inv16 \\
  &\land Inv1325 \\
  &\land Inv1291 \\
  &\land Inv29 \\
  &\land Inv11 \\
  &\land Inv1 \\
  &\land Inv53 \\
  &\land Inv1140 \\
  &\land Inv7 \\
  &\land Inv4
\end{align*}
$$

It can be seen that these individual lemmas establish various important facts/invariants about the protocol, but,
in this form, it is quite hard to understand the logical structure of the inductive invariant and how it represents the correctness argument for establishing the top-level safety property. 

Instead we can view inductive invariants through the lens of an *inductive proof graph*, a graph structure that explicitly represents the compositional structure of an inductive invariant. We concretely exploit these structures for automated inductive invariant inference technique in [1], and to also improve the interactivity and interpretability of the inductive invariant development process. We can do this by breaking down the logical structure of a monolithic inductive invariant like the one shown above, which is stated simply as a conjunction of many lemmas. For any inductive invariant of this form, 

$$
Ind = S \wedge  L_1 \wedge \dots \wedge L_k
$$

each lemma in this overall invariant may only depend inductively on some other subset of lemmas in $$Ind$$. More formally, proving the consecution step of such an invariant requires establishing validity of the following formula

$$
\begin{align}
    (S \wedge L_1 \wedge \dots \wedge L_k) \wedge T \Rightarrow (S \wedge L_1 \wedge \dots \wedge L_k)'
\end{align}
$$

which can be decomposed into the following set of independent proof obligations:

$$
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        (S \wedge L_1 \wedge \dots \wedge L_k) &\wedge T \Rightarrow S' \\
        (S \wedge L_1 \wedge \dots \wedge L_k) &\wedge T \Rightarrow L_1' \\
        &\vdots \\[0.1em]
        (S \wedge L_1 \wedge \dots \wedge L_k) &\wedge T \Rightarrow L_k'
    \end{split}
\end{align}
$$

For distributed and concurrent protocols, the transition relation of a system $$M=(I,T)$$ is typically a disjunction of several distinct actions i.e., $$T=A_1 \vee \dots \vee A_n$$.

So, each node of a lemma support graph can be augmented with sub-nodes, one for each action of the overall transition relation. Lemma support edges in the graph then run from a lemma to a specific action node, rather than directly to a target lemma. Incorporation of this action-based decomposition now lets us define the full inductive proof graph structure.



<!-- Instead, we can take advantage of the udnerlying compositional structure of an inductive invariant to develop an inductive proof graph, which is a graph structure corresponds to an inductive invariant while explicitly representing the induction relationships between protocol transitions/actions and lemmas of the invariant. -->

For example, the inductive invariant for the *TwoPhase* protocol above corresponds to the following inductive proof graph:

<img src="/assets/ind-proof-graphs/TwoPhase_ind-proof-tree-sd1.png" alt="Inductive Proof Graph Example" width="700">

This figure illustrates the structure of an inductive proof graph. The nodes represent individual invariants or lemmas, while the edges show the dependencies between them. This visual representation helps in understanding the logical flow and compositional nature of the inductive invariant.

For example, $$Inv11$$ supports the top level safety property via RMRcvAbortMsg, stating that

$$
Inv11 \triangleq \forall rm_j \in \text{RM} : (\langle \stext{Abort} \rangle \in msgsAbort) \Rightarrow \neg(rmState[rm_j] = \text{"committed"}) 
$$

That is, that if an abort message has been sent, then no resource manager can be in a committed state. The preservation of this invariant is sufficient to prevent violation of the safety property $$TCConsistent$$ via some RMRcvAbortMsg action, since it ensures no abort messages can be present in the system if a some resource manager has already committed. We can trace the lineage of this logically backward, to one of its other support lemmas

$$
Inv53 \triangleq \forall rm_i \in \text{RM} : (tmState = \text{"init"}) \Rightarrow \neg(rmState[rm_i] = \text{"committed"})
$$

which prevents the present of any committed resource managers in the initial state. Similarly, its other support lemma

$$
Inv1 \triangleq (\langle \stext{Abort} \rangle \in msgsAbort) \Rightarrow (\langle \stext{Commit} \rangle \notin msgsCommit) 
$$

ensures that presence of an abort message in the system precludes the presence of a commit message, since this could *lead* to a resource manager then becoming committed. Finally, both of these lemmas $$Inv53$$ and $$Inv1$$ are then supported by 

$$
\begin{align}
Inv7 &\triangleq \neg(tmState = \text{"init"}) \Rightarrow (\langle \stext{Abort} \rangle \notin msgsAbort) \\
Inv4 &\triangleq \neg(tmState = \text{"init"}) \Rightarrow (\langle \stext{Commit} \rangle \notin msgsCommit)
\end{align}
$$

which ensure that, initially, no commit/abort messages can be present in the system.

An additional feature afforded by this proof graph decomposition is the aspect of *variable slices*. TODO.

These proof graphs essentially make explicit the kind of backward reasoning that is applied when trying to show correctness of a safety property. That is, we work backwards via protocol actions, finding
invariants that must be required to hold true in prior steps in order for the system to always be safe with respect to some target property in question. In some ways, we can also view these proof graphs as a way of, to some extent, marrying the inductive invariants used for formal verification with the kind of semi-formal, pen and paper proof structures often written by humans. For example, a proof in a PODC/DISC paper may somewhat closely resemble this kind of structure, but these proof graph structures provide a useful way to make this completely formal (and mechanizable, automatable), while also showing that these types of graph structures can be seen as ultimately equivalent to any inductive invariant. 

### Cyclic Proof Graphs

Note that the definition of proof graphs do not imply any restriction on cycles in a valid inductive proof graph. A simple example of a purely cyclic proof graph is as follows. Consider a simple ring counter system with 3 state variables, $$a,b$$, and $$c$$, where a single value gets passed from ùëé to ùëè to ùëê and exactly one variable holds the value at any time. An inductive invariant establishing the property that ùëé always has a well-formed value will consist of 3 properties that form a 3-cycle, each stating that ùëé,ùëè and ùëê‚Äôs state are, respectively, always well-formed.

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{VARIABLE } a,b,c \\
&\text{Init }  \equiv a = 1 \land b = 0 \land c = 0 \\
\\
A & \equiv a > 0 \land b' = a \land a' = 0 \land c'=c \\
B & \equiv b > 0 \land c' = b \land b' = 0 \land a'=a \\
C & \equiv c > 0 \land a' = c \land c' = 0 \land b'=b \\
\\
\text{Next } & \equiv A \lor B \lor C \\
\\
\text{Inv } & \equiv a \in \{0,1\} \quad \text{(* top-level invariant. *)} \\
\\
L1 & \equiv b \in \{0,1\} \\
L2 & \equiv c \in \{0,1\}
\end{align*}
$$
