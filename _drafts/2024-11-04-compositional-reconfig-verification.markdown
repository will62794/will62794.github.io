title:  "Interaction Preserving Compositional Verification of Reconfiguration"
categories: distributed-systems verification
---

Verifying distributed protocols that support dynamic reconfiguration presents unique challenges. While compositional verification techniques have been successful for static protocols, they often break down when dealing with reconfiguration due to the complex interactions between the reconfiguration mechanism and the base protocol. We explore an approach to compositional verification that preserves these essential interactions while allowing separate reasoning about reconfiguration safety.

## The Challenge of Reconfiguration Verification

Reconfiguration in distributed systems allows for dynamic changes to the set of participating nodes while maintaining safety properties of the underlying protocol. However, proving correctness of reconfigurable protocols is notably more difficult than their static counterparts for several reasons:

1. Interaction between reconfiguration and base protocol actions
2. Temporal dependencies between configuration changes
3. Need to maintain safety across configuration transitions

## Compositional Verification Approach

Traditional compositional verification techniques often struggle with reconfigurable protocols because they try to completely separate the reconfiguration mechanism from the base protocol. Instead, we propose preserving the essential interactions between these components while still enabling separate reasoning about their properties.

Key aspects of this approach include:

- Identifying and preserving critical interaction points between reconfiguration and base protocol
- Defining interface properties that capture these interactions
- Separate verification of reconfiguration safety properties
- Composition theorem showing how local properties combine to ensure global correctness

## Example: Reconfigurable Consensus

Consider a reconfigurable consensus protocol. Rather than trying to verify the reconfiguration mechanism in complete isolation, we:

1. Identify key interactions (e.g., how configuration changes affect quorum intersection)
2. Define interface properties capturing these interactions
3. Prove properties about reconfiguration separately while preserving interfaces
4. Compose the proofs to show overall protocol correctness

This approach provides a middle ground between fully compositional and monolithic verification strategies.
